# bm
bookmark tool inspired by saved.io

For my own personal use.
Type the site you're running this on before the URL you want to bookmark. 

e.g. If you want to bookmark xkcd.com you go to http://yourserverrunningbm.tld/xkcd.com

See your bookmarks by going to /mybookmarks. 

Bookmarks are saved in bm.json

# usage
```
Usage of ./bm:
  -file="bm.json": file to save bm
  -host="": hostname to listen on (like apache virtualhost)
  -port="8889": port the webserver listens on
```
