# bm
bookmark tool inspired by saved.io

For my own personal use.
Type the site you're running this on before the URL you want to bookmark. 
See your bookmarks by going to /mybookmarks. 

Bookmarks are saved in bm.json

# usage
```
Usage of ./bm:
  -file="bm.json": file to save bm
  -host="": hostname to listen on (like apache virtualhost)
  -port="8889": port the webserver listens on
```
